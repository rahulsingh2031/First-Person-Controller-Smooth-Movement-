A smooth First person Controller modular enough that you could add your own state easily as well as base controller movement also feels good
- Current base setup is perfect to headStart your project
- You can toggle on/off any movement/camera feature during runtime easily
- Uses CharacterController component instead of rigidBody to make the controller not jittery during movement in slopes
